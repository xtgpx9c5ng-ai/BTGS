## 🛠 Build Instructions (Linux)
Building the node and command-line interface is straightforward. You only need to create a build directory and use CMake.

### **Building `bitcoingoldd` and `bitcoingold-cli`**
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/BTGSCOINDEV/BTGS.git](https://github.com/BTGSCOINDEV/BTGS.git)
    cd BTGS
    ```

2.  **Configure and Build:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j$(nproc)
    ```
*The binary files (`bitcoingoldd` and `bitcoingold-cli`) will be located in the `bin/` directory within your build folder.* 

*Want to automate this? You can easily fork this repository and enable the GitHub Actions workflow. Once enabled, the workflow will automatically trigger, build the binaries for all platforms ('Linux', 'Windows', 'macOS'), and prepare them for you instantly upon every push.*

## 💡 BGC-20 Protocol
The **BGC-20** protocol is our answer to the growing demand for on-chain data. By leveraging the security of SHA-256, users can "inscribe" data into the BTGS blockchain, creating a permanent, immutable record for tokens and digital art, mirroring the success of BRC-20 on the Bitcoin network.
